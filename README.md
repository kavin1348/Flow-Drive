Note: 
1. Bitbar/testdroid is experiencing technical issues. So if any test run fails, please try again after some time. 
2. In case if nothing works, fret not, I have already executed a full test under Kavin Test Project, which contains the recordings/screenshots of the test. 

Alternately, you can also reach out to me anytime in case of any questions or issues.
